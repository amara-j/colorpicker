A color palette picker built in React.

To use: press the space bar to generate a new palette of five colors. Hover over any color swatch to view its hex color code, and click anywhere on a swatch to copy its code to your clipboard. If you find a color you love, click the heart icon below its swatch to pin it on your screenâ€“ pinned swatches won't change when you press the spacebar. Keep pressing and pinning until you find a color scheme you love. Happy scheming:)
