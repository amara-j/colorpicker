To use: press the space bar to randomly generate a new palette of five colors.  Hover over any color swatch to view its Hex color code, and click anywhere on a swatch to copy its code to your clipboard.  If you find a color you love, click the heart icon below its swatch to pin it on your screen– pinned swatches won't change when you press the spacebar.  Keep pressing and pinning until you find a color scheme you love.  Happy scheming!
